### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
I've worked on some diverses projects mostly focused on fronted developing, using React but also I'm able to work on the backend using nodeJs, I've been roled as Team co-leader where I designed some of my team's tasks and responsabilities, and chenked the correct development and implementation of them. I've been working as a frontend developer for about 3 years, I like to focus on the details, the good-looking and overall, the simplicity of a web Application in order to make the user understand, like and enjoy the App.
